                            Howdy! I am currently a senior studying <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/ce/index.html">Computer Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a>.
							Since I was young, I always enjoyed math and science, much to the dismay of my peers, but never had a clear picture in mind of what I actually wanted to do later in life. I 
							really stumbled into my major when I took a simple Intro to Engineering Design course in high school and found myself really enjoying it. My later experiences with electronic
							circuits and computer science cemented my path, and I even managed to find a major where I could enjoy both of them together! 
						</p>
						<p class="mainText">
							When I’m not swamped with course work, which is unfortunately rare, I enjoy playing tennis, rock climbing, the occasional video game,
							and skiing (though obviously not an on-campus activity). Over the long summer break my family and I like to travel, and over the past 22 years I've been fortunate enough to
							visit 16 countries around the world and 21 US states. Home for me, at current, is Dallas, TX but I was actually born in Düsseldorf, Germany and spent my early childhood
							in Sydney, Australia. I still have some family from my father’s side in Germany, including my grandparents whom we make an effort to visit often. With all the travel we’ve done,
							I have found the most reliable source of entertainment to be a good book, especially on a long flight. Thus, I have turned into quite the book worm, often devouring entire
							series in a couple of days. I’ve always enjoyed fantasy and epic fantasy as they provide a great escape from reality, but a number of sci-fi and historical fiction books have
							also caught my eye. The summer internship hunt over the past couple of years along with the shutdown of long-distance travel around the pandemic have unfortunately limited our
							recent travel options but I am hopeful that we will still manage to go skiing this winter!
